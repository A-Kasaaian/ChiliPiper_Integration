This code can be combined with other methods listed in this repository to automatically redirect a prospect if they take no action once the calendar is loaded.

*This is not a drop-in add-on. Some adjustments to your existing code will be required to make this work*

* Add the code from `landing_page.html` above your existing Chili Piper code
* Adjust and add the code from `add_on_code.js` to your existing Chili Piper implementation code, right above `ChiliPiper.submit...`
