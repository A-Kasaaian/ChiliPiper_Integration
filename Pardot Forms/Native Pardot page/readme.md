This method should be used with native Pardot pages.

How this works:
#TODO

How to set this up:
1. Add the code from Step_1.html to the **Look & Feel â†’ Below Form Code Editor**
2. Add the code from Step_2.html to the **Parent Webpage** in which the Pardot form code resides or to the **Thank you page** if a redirect is enabled.
   * Step_2_NO_JS.html can be used to avoid loading Chili Piper marketing.js script and will redirect a prospect to a booking link instead
3. Map the values from the submitData object to your Chili Piper Form which is mapped to your Router
